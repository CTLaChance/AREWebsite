    "testimonial": "Kathy and Rhonda have done an excellent job putting the Algebra Readiness Builder series together. Each of the books in the series address the curriculum necessary to be successful in that grade or course. The books not only address key topics but also provides hints to help students who might not have been taught that topic yet or have forgotten. What I like best about these books is the review and repetition of skills along with the constant reminders of key vocabulary. If a student works through all 80 pages of one of these books they will have the knowledge and skills necessary to be successful in the next grade or course."

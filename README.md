# Algebra Readiness Educators, LLC Website
This is the most recent redesign of the Algebra Readiness Educator, LLC website. Care was taken to ensure the redesign was easily accessible on mobile devices by following the principles of responsive design. This update also introduced Javascript functionality to the site, something it had previously been lacking. 

This redesign was a significant overhaul of the first revision of the website which was originally created using Adobe Dreamweaver. An unfortunate side effect of using WISWYG editors is that manipulating the HTML file directly becomes significantly more challenging due to the addition of superfluous html tags and comments, embedded CSS selectors and Javascript functions, and obfuscated div class and id names. However, this update was coded by hand entirely using the Brackets text editor which allows any future changes or modification to be applied much more rapidly and without the need to install Dreamweaver or another WISWYG editor.
